# Rock, Paper, Scissors :rock: :clipboard: :scissors:
## Goals
I am making the traditional rock, paper, scissor using Python and I'm building a GUI front-end interface alongside it via tkinter.


## Process
### Inspiration
I was inspired by ChatGPT. It gave me a list of beginner projects I could do and this one had mentioned GUI in particular. As a noob developer, I defintely feel like I have this cool, new ability to make things, but I'm still not sure of all the infinite possiblities I can do still. 

When ChatGPT reccomended this one to me, it mentioned a GUI and it left me curious since i had never heard this term before. I'm still discovering so many things in the developing field everyday and even though it seemed a bit daunting, I just had to jump in a try to figure this out.

### Developing a plan
Here are the steps I am taking to build this thing:
1. Starting with game logic
2. Creating the GUI structure
3. Connecting the logic to the structure

From what I've read, online, this should be the most simple strategy for myself so I don't get too overwhelmed learning GUI and going through the Tkinter documentation.

I also used this chart as a visual aid on the scenarios ![rock paper scissors outcome table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24843872/80303689-53ac4400-87cf-11ea-96d1-7f845e6f1379.png)

### Takeaways & What I Learned
- How to read documentation
It was actually a lot more simple than I had orginally thught, but takes some time for sure.
- Fuctions
In all of the practice python assignments, I never had to really use functions so this was great practice.
In this case, the fuctions did not need to return any variable back since it all appears in the GUI.
- Objects outside of Python
Something I'm still trying to understand is objects in python. IntVar(), and StringVar() are both TKinter objects which really threw me off. I really need to pay attention to what objects are coming from what library so I can more effienctly build these programs.

#### Help Wanted 
If you know why 
`for child in mainFrame.winfo_children(): <br> child.grid_configure(padx=5, pady=5)`
wasn't working for me, please let me know! It didn't seem to work no matter where I had placed it in the code.

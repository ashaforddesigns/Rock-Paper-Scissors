# Rock, Paper, Scissors :rock: :paper: :scissors:
## Goals
I am making the traditional rock, paper, scissor using Python and I'm building a GUI front-end interface alongside it via tkinter.


## Process
<!--No text needed-->
### Inspiration
I was inspired by ChatGPT. It gave me a list of beginner projects I could do and this one had mentioned GUI in particular. As a noob developer, I defintely feel like I have this cool, new ability to make things, but I'm still not sure of all the infinite possiblities I can do still. 

When ChatGPT reccomended this one to me, it mentioned a GUI and it left me curious since i had never heard this term before. I'm still discovering so many things in the developing field everyday and even though it seemed a bit daunting, I just had to jump in a try to figure this out.

### Developing a plan
Here are the steps I am taking to build this thing:
1. Starting with game logic
2. Creating the GUI structure
3. Connecting the logic to the structure

From what I've read, online, this should be the most simple strategy for myself so I don't get too overwhelmed learning GUI and going through the Tkinter documentation.

### Takeaways & What I Learned

I'm looking forward to finally watching some of the hangman tutorials out there to see what other ways people have decided to solve this. Maybe I'll learn something new!
